# 🦔 AI-Hedgehog

Your friendly AI coding companion that provides real-time feedback on your code as you write it.

Instead of complex and fancy copilot or cursor style solutions just open this tool from the command line along side your favourite editor.

Hedgehog's always recommend writing code yourself to stay sharp but having help and getting suggestions isn't a bad idea!

## Features

- 🔍 Watches your code files and provides instant AI feedback when they change
- 🤖 Supports multiple AI models (Claude, Llama, etc.)
- 🛠️ Works with any editor or IDE
- 🚀 Easy to use with minimal setup
- 🔧 Highly configurable

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hibernatus-hacker/ai-hedgehog
cd ai-hedgehog
npm link
ai-hedgehog -d ./directory_to_watch # from anywhere
```
